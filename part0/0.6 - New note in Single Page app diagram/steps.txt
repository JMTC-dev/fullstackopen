A HTML input element and button (submit) element is rendered to the page by the HTML code

User writes their note in the input element and clicks the submit button element which triggers an event listener in the JavaScript code.

The browser executes the event listener in the JavaScript code. The code makes an HTTP POST request to the address https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa, which sends a request to the server.

The server checks if the note input is of valid type string, creates the note object and pushes it to the notes array.
