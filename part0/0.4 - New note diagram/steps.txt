A HTML input element and button (submit) element is rendered to the page by the HTML code

User writes their note in the input element and clicks the submit button element which triggers an event listener in the JavaScript code.

The browser executes the event listener in the JavaScript code. The code makes an HTTP POST request to the address https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note, which sends a request to the server.

The server checks if the note input is of valid type string, creates the note object and pushes it to the notes array and then redirects the user to the notes page. This creates a HTTP Get request to the address   https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes

The browser fetches the HTML code defining the content and the structure of the page from the server using an HTTP GET request.

Links in the HTML code cause the browser to also fetch the CSS style sheet main.css...

...and the JavaScript code file main.js

The browser executes the JavaScript code. The code makes an HTTP GET request to the address https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json, which returns the notes as JSON data.

When the data has been fetched, the browser executes an event handler, which renders the notes to the page using the DOM-API.
